# NoteCards
This is a project I created with the purpose of using NoteCards to study. This app lets you create categories such as Math, Science, etc.
You can click on these categories to then enter them and create notecards for them. While you are on the main activity, you can position
your finger over any category and swipe to the left to bring up two boxed items. One is used to delete said category and the other one is to modify the category in case you want to
change its name. 

The functionality of having a litview that supports swiping was integrated into my project. This is a really nice library that was found here on github.

This was exactly what I was looking for when designing my project.
